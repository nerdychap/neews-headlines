# Modus News App

This project was created using Create React App. It shows a list of headline news based on a search query and published date. By default, the search query is 'Apple' and the date is not important.

## Setup

In order to set up the application locally, the repository needs to be cloned from Github.
After cloning the repository, dependencies need to be install using: 

### npm install

After installing the dependencies, the app can be run in development using: 

### npm start

The production version of the application can be accessed by first doing a production build using: 

### npm build

Then served locally using:

### serve -s build

## Note***

-The free newsAPI can only be used in a local environment, so the API can't be accessed from a remotely hosted application. 
-The newsAPI free version only allows up to 100 requests in a 24-hour period from 1 developer API key.
-The article dates can only go as far back as 18 October 2018
